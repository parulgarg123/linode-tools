SYNOPSIS
--------

Command-line Usage:

  linode.py [username]

  linode.rb [username]

Library usage:

  Python:

    import linode
    ...
    info = linode.Info(username)
    print info.xml, "Fetched by %s on %s" % (info.user, info.timestamp)

  Ruby:

    require 'linode'
    ...
    info = LinodeInfo.new(username).fetch
    puts info.xml, "Fetched by #{info.user} on #{info.timestamp}"


DESCRIPTION
-----------

These scripts are intended to be roughly the identical, at least in terms of
functionality.  Some implementation differs, however:

  - attempts were made to use only standard libraries. python's xpath was the
    only failing in this.
  - ruby's net libraries are more robust/elegant than python's.
  - ruby's time/date parsing is more robust/intelligent than python's.
  - other differences relating to __getattr__ (python) and method_missing
    (ruby) functionality.

The scripts accept a username as their first argument.  If none is given, they
infer it from the $USER variable.  This username is the username used to
identify yourself to Linode dashboard and/or lish shell; it is *not* related
to any account on the hosted linode system.

By design, the data is not fetched


HISTORY
-------

These are ports from a perl script written by efudd <bw@broked.net> available
